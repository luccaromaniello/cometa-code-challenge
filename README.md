# Cometa Code - Frontend Challenge

## Features

- Replicated the interface using Vue.js
- Implemented a responsive design
- Added interactivity

## Considerations

- It wasn’t specified whether CSS preprocessors or libraries could be used. In my interpretation, this was open, so I chose Tailwind CSS for styling.

- The Figma file lacked standardization in some styles, especially gradients and button components. To avoid inconsistencies, I opted to standardize a few elements. Since the instructions left room for interpretation, I believe this approach aligns with the challenge's intent.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands should be run from the root of the project in a terminal. I'm using `Bun, but you can also use any JavaScript runtime like npm, Yarn, etc.
